# Data Structures and Algorithms Projects Repository
Welcome to my Data Structures and Algorithms repository! As a Level 5 student in Data Structures and Algorithms, I have built a series of projects that demonstrate my understanding of core concepts and their practical applications. This repository showcases nine projects, including implementations of foundational data structures and advanced features.

# Featured Projects
1. Singly Linked List (Library) - A simple and efficient linked list implementation for sequential data storage and traversal.
2. Queue (Library) - A custom implementation of the Queue data structure with essential operations.
3. Stack (Library) - A robust Stack implementation designed for general-purpose use.
4. DynamicArray (Library) - A flexible array implementation that dynamically resizes as needed.
5. QueueArr - A queue implementation optimized using arrays.
6. StackArr - An array-based implementation of the Stack data structure.
7. Undo/Redo Project - A real-world application demonstrating undo/redo functionality using stacks.
8. Queue Line Project - A project simulating real-world queue operations for task or customer management.

# Why This Repository?
These projects reflect my ability to design, implement, and optimize data structures and algorithms. They also highlight my understanding of computational efficiency, memory management, and practical problem-solving.
