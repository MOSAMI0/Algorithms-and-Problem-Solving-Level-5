# Data Structures and Algorithms Projects Repository
Welcome to my Data Structures and Algorithms repository! While my foundational knowledge of data structures is at Level 1, my algorithmic thinking and problem-solving skills are at Level 5. Through these projects, Iâ€™ve honed my ability to tackle complex challenges, optimize performance, and create efficient, scalable solutions.

Explore my work to see how I bridge the gap between theoretical concepts and practical applications, delivering robust and innovative systems.

# Featured Projects
1. DoublyLinkedList (Library) - A versatile implementation of a doubly linked list, enabling efficient bidirectional traversal.
2. Queue (Library) - A custom implementation of the Queue data structure with essential operations.
3. Stack (Library) - A robust Stack implementation designed for general-purpose use.
4. DynamicArray (Library) - A flexible array implementation that dynamically resizes as needed.
5. QueueArr - A queue implementation optimized using arrays.
6. StackArr - An array-based implementation of the Stack data structure.
7. Undo/Redo Project - A real-world application demonstrating undo/redo functionality using stacks.
8. Queue Line Project - A project simulating real-world queue operations for task or customer management.

# Why This Repository?
These projects reflect my ability to design, implement, and optimize data structures and algorithms. They also highlight my understanding of computational efficiency, memory management, and practical problem-solving.
